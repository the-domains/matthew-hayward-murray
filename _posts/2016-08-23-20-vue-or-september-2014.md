What do you get when you combine advanced mobile technology and a society addicted to social media? A marketing researcher's dream. In response to the recent boom in the market for wireless devices and social media platforms, many researchers are now able to utilize these platforms for data collection, pulling unprecedented amounts of information from diverse audiences in a matter of minutes. We decided to take advantage of this emerging trend in data collection to examine how the proliferation of smartphones, tablets and laptops is changing the way we watch television.

When doing an online search on social media and television viewing, it does not take long to come across the term "second screening." This refers to the use of an additional device such as a smartphone, tablet or laptop while watching television. There has been very little research done in Canada on exactly how second screening is influencing television ratings and how television companies can leverage these second screens as a tool to form deeper engagement with audience members. Hence, an ideal focus for our research.

Research Questions and Samples

For our study, we decided to focus on two research questions:

1\. Is there a relationship between television ratings and Twitter interactions across multiple episodes of Canadian television shows?

2\. What type of content drives people to tweet while watching television?

With direction from BBM Canada -- the country's radio and television ratings measurement organization -- we selected MasterChef Canada and Chopped Canada as the programs of

focus. The episodes included in our analyses were the first eleven episodes of the inaugural season of Chopped Canada, which aired on Food Network Canada, and the first eight episodes of the inaugural season of MasterChef Canada, which aired on CTV.

The data we were provided with came from two samples. The first was BBM Canada's panel of Canadian television viewers who volunteer to carry around with them a portable people meter (PPM), a device that detects inaudible codes that are embedded within all radio and television broadcasts. BBM Canada selects its panel members using a multi-staged sampling technique to ensure that participants are representative of the national population of Canada in order to estimate ratings across the country. Our second sample consisted of Twitter users who posted tweets about either of these shows during the airing of our selected episodes. The data-mining platform DataSift was used to gather this information. We used a series of appropriate hashtags and Twitter handles to refine our sample to only include those posts that actually referenced the shows. In an effort to ensure that our samples were consistent, we further refined our Twitter sample by only including posts from Twitter users who indicated that they were Canadian.

Method

In order to get a full understanding of the relationship between TV ratings and Twitter interactions, we took a mixed-method approach. Firstly, we conducted statistical analyses to examine minute-by-minute correlations between the number of tweets and the ratings for each show, as well as trends in the number of tweets posted throughout season. Secondly, we conducted a content/sentiment analysis to better understand what is driving people to tweet.

Results The findings from our correlational analysis were nothing short of exciting. For almost every episode we examined, the correlations between the number of Twitter posts and television ratings were significantly positive. This suggests that as ratings increase, the number of tweets also increased. Of the handful of episodes that did not show a significant positive correlation, we were able to determine why this may have been the case. For example, Chopped Canada experienced technical difficulties during one episodes and it aired an hour late. Also, CTV broadcast an episode of MasterChef Canada immediately following the Super Bowl, which resulted in a significant, negative correlation. (Some further insight as to why this occurred was found in our content and sentiment analyses.)

But are They Engaged?

In order to understand the extent to which Twitter and television activity was sustained beyond the novelty of the first few episodes, we compared early, middle and late groupings of episodes. Our findings indicated that viewers of MasterChef Canada remain engaged via Twitter from the beginning of a season through to the end, whereas Chopped Canada viewers were not as consistent in their engagement on Twitter. The frequency of tweeter activity surrounding early season episodes of Chopped Canada were statistically higher when compared to mid and late season episodes. This suggests that Chopped Canada is unable to hold the attention of most viewers beyond the hype of the first few episodes. This is likely due to the format of the show, which does not follow contestants from week to week and thus does not offer an overarching plot to captivate viewers.

What are They Tweeting About?

Our study was one of the first to examine Twitter content in order to provide insights into what drives viewers to tweet while watching reality cooking shows. Using content analysis, findings from this study suggest that Twitter content regarding MasterChef Canada and Chopped Canada is very different in nature. Tweets surrounding Chopped Canada tend to be driven by a sense of connectivity toward the show and fellow viewers, whereas tweets about MasterChef Canada tend to be driven by

competition and entertainment (see graph for a full breakdown of tweets by sentiment). We did find one commonality between the two shows, in that a large portion of the tweets featured the contestants as their subject. Interestingly, the two shows differ quite drastically in their format. Investment in the contestants for MasterChef Canada is understandable, as this is a traditional, episodic program that follows the same contestants week after week. This allows viewers the opportunity to get an in-depth look at each contestant and the time to relate to or become empathetic towards particular contestants. Meanwhile, Chopped Canada features a cooking competition that is completed in the course of each episode with contestants that do not return the following week.

Conclusions and Insights

The take-home message of our research is simple: gone are the days of passive television viewing! It is obvious that networks are placing a higher value on audience engagement, and are attempting to connect with their viewers and fuel conversations online, a marketing strategy that so far has been successful, as indicated by the positive relationship between Twitter interactions and Chopped /MasterChef Canada television ratings in our study.

Taking these findings into account, it is predicted that in the future a show's worth will be partially based on its social media level of engagement with viewers. Our study found that viewers are most engaged with what appears to be forging strong relationships with TV personalities. This viewer interest surrounding reality contestants can create a lucrative opportunity for networks if they cast people with the right personality for their target audience.

For example Chopped Canada airs on Food Network Canada, a niche network geared toward foodies. The show inspired a substantial number of tweets that involved sharing recipes and discussing food dishes, whereas CTV's MasterChef Canada tweets were predominantly of an entertainment-driven nature. Taking these findings into account, networks should gear Twitter conversation as well as television content to fit the interests of conversation to increase fan engagement. And let's face it, an engaged viewer on Twitter is a word-of-mouth advertiser for television programs. This will only fuel broadcasters to continue to come up with creative onscreen hashtags. Love it or hate it, we think it's safe to say the merger of social media and television is here to stay.
